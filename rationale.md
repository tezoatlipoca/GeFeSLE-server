## Um, ok. But Why? 
When I left Twitter in November of 2022 and discovered the Fediverse, I noticed that - because there's no algorithm.. or rather YOU and your network are the algorithm - discovery is somewhat manual. In the early Twitter exodus there were lots of people throwing up Google Sheet curated lists of journalists or interesting people or bots to follow - I figured there had to be a better way.  

  _GeFeSLE lets you make lists of THINGS, curate them with friends, share them with the world.. in a way that people can bookmark and keep coming back to._

After a few months of using Mastodon, and bookmarking so many interesting toots, I realized that I had no way to curate them! There's no export from your Mastodon bookmarks outside of using the API and exporting the raw JSON. (There is the excellent [Pocket Toots FIrefox plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pockettoots/) which exports _new_ bookmarks to Pocket, but its not retroactive.)

  _GeFeSLE lets you import THINGS from various places (Mastodon Bookmarks, Microsoft Sticky Notes, Google Tasks), curate them with tags, and sort them into your own lists._

Every time I go to use Trello or any other tool/service, I get fed up with constant two factor authentication hassles, and having to use _their_ app - whatever happened to using a web browser? plus my smartphone is an ancient Oreo device - half my apps don't work anymore; why should access to a service be gatekept because Im not rocking a new phone? 
AND, if I make a wicked list of something in Trello, there's no way to have friends (real or internet) help me unless I make a special group, and they all have to have accounts in that service. AND I can't export my list; there's no "show My Trello Board ON the Internet" feature.   

  _GeFeSLE is a single binary and a database file; its serves only basic HTML and javascript that can be read by some really old browsers._

Lastly, there is the [**enshittification** problem - pluralistic](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys): what happens to your content when the platform that hosts it turns evil: spams your readers with too many ads, invites the nazis in or just removes or bans your content because of something you said? (That should be up to YOUR readers to decide, not the platform!) The way to fight enshittification is to **self-host**. 

This service will only be about making, and hosting, _lists of things_ and will only add features in service of that end.  Our goals:

- nothing but lists
- import lists from places easily
- export lists in forms that can be easily taken elsewhere
- preemptively support takedown requests and content moderation
- let you control who can SEE your lists, who can help curate your lists. 
- make self-hosting lists fun and easy

IMDB started off as a bunch of TEXT file lists of actors and movies shared via newsgroups. Before search engines got good, we found stuff through lists of things, even other lists! Lets bring that back.
