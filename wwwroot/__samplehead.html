<!-- THIS IS A SAMPLE PAGE HEAD INTO THE HEAD ELEMENT OF EVERY PAGE. 
    samplehead.html
    (you're obviously reading the page source to see this -hi!)
It is added into every page's &lt;head&gt; element.</p>

You can change this by creating a new html file (shouldn't be complete HTML) and referencing it in your config file like:</p>

    "SiteCustomize": {
        "sitehead": "__samplehead.html",
        "bodyheader": "__samplebodyhead.html",
        "bodyfooter": "__samplefooter.html"
    }
THEN REGENERATE YOUR PAGES
-->
